# Course Selection Software

This is an application that made by a terp, and for all terps.

## How is it different from the well-known Courseoff?

Courseoff is a powerful platform for acquiring some essential information when selecting courses. 
However, this application offers more customized experience. 

### Features

(that courseoff cannot provide)

- [X] Filter out less preferred professors/instructors. 

- [X] Exclude less favorable time period such as 8 o'clock in a freezing winter morning. 

- [X] Hiding *Freshman Connection Program* related information. 

- [X] Enumerate all possible combinations with the current course configuration. 

- [X] Peek on the number of open seats and wait lists for a given section. 

And in addition, since all of the data are crawled from Testudo, it gets updated really fast. 

### Drawbacks

- Apparently, it is a Windows application so it cannot run on your mobile phone, nor Macbook :(

- Also, there is no any *sign in* or *Share* button so you cannot compare the schedule with your friend directly. 

## Installation

**Download Address:** [Terp Connect](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~yishanzh/Course%20Selection%20Software/publish.htm)

You can download and install the application directly from the webpage. 

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> As you may notice that your Windows is trying to stop you by popping up a warning dialog. This is because that a piece of published software needs to have a legit certificate to show that it's not malware. 
>
> However, this certificate **requires fund** (and a lot! ) which is something that I lack of, so... 
>
> If you are still feeling suspicious, feel free to have a look on the source codes, and compile them manually. 
>
> By clicking the *More Info* button (or something like that), a button will be revealed. Click the install button to continue installing. 

If the progress bar for installation is moving slowly, it may be downloading some dependencies such as *.NET library*. It is possibly because your computer is running an old version of Windows or you actively rejected many Windows update patches. 

**Lastly, **

Since this application uses *ClickOnce* to distribute and deploy, it will automatically check for update every time when it is launched. It is normal for this process to take a few seconds. 

## Some thoughts

This application is developed in my precious leisure time, so it would be too luxurious for me to leave blocks of time on testing and finding potential bugs. As a result, if you find any, please see the section below:

## Feedbacks

Feel free to give any advise or feedbacks. Although I might (definitely) not have enough time for tracing every bug, I will still try to locate and exterminate critical ones. 

It would be even nicer of you could try to offer me some clues for a specific bug, or even help me to improve the codes!
